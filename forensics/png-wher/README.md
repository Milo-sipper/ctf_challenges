> Where did my png go? It's almost as if the dimensions-space-whatever time continuum was broken when I ate it this morning. However, I did hear something called a CRCket was the key to getting my lost png back.

Difficulty **Medium**

## Description
Bruteforce the dimensions of the png using a script, as the crc should have the original dimensions of the image. Then, fix the png.
